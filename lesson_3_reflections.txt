- When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I think the best would be to do so when you expect to be working on different machines (laptop, mobile...), also when more than one person is working on the same project at the same time.

- Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Just in case I have been working on both my local folder and GitHub and need to change the name of a file or move some stuff around before syncing my repositories.
